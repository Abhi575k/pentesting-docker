# Advanced Scans Using Nmap

## Null Scan
The null scan does not set any flag; all six flag bits are set to zero. You can choose this scan using the -sN option. A TCP packet with no flags set will not trigger any response when it reaches an open port, as shown in the figure below. Therefore, from Nmap’s perspective, a lack of reply in a null scan indicates that either the port is open or a firewall is blocking the packet.
However, we expect the target server to respond with an RST packet if the port is closed. Consequently, we can use the lack of RST response to figure out the ports that are not closed: open or filtered.

## FIN Scan
The FIN scan sends a TCP packet with the FIN flag set. You can choose this scan type using the -sF option. Similarly, no response will be sent if the TCP port is open. Again, Nmap cannot be sure if the port is open or if a firewall is blocking the traffic related to this TCP port.
However, the target system should respond with an RST if the port is closed. Consequently, we will be able to know which ports are closed and use this knowledge to infer the ports that are open or filtered. It's worth noting some firewalls will 'silently' drop the traffic without sending an RST.

## Xmas Scan
The Xmas scan gets its name after Christmas tree lights. An Xmas scan sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags simultaneously. You can select Xmas scan with the option -sX.

Like the Null scan and FIN scan, if an RST packet is received, it means that the port is closed. Otherwise, it will be reported as open|filtered.

One scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.

## TCP ACK Scan
Let’s start with the TCP ACK scan. As the name implies, an ACK scan will send a TCP packet with the ACK flag set. Use the -sA option to choose this scan. As we show in the figure below, the target would respond to the ACK with RST regardless of the state of the port. This behaviour happens because a TCP packet with the ACK flag set should be sent only in response to a received TCP packet to acknowledge the receipt of some data, unlike our case. Hence, this scan won’t tell us whether the target port is open in a simple setup.
This kind of scan would be helpful if there is a firewall in front of the target. Consequently, based on which ACK packets resulted in responses, you will learn which ports were not blocked by the firewall. In other words, this type of scan is more suitable to discover firewall rule sets and configuration.

## Window Scan
Another similar scan is the TCP window scan. The TCP window scan is almost the same as the ACK scan; however, it examines the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On specific systems, this can reveal that the port is open. You can select this scan type with the option -sW. As shown in the figure below, we expect to get an RST packet in reply to our “uninvited” ACK packets, regardless of whether the port is open or closed.

## Custom Scan
If you want to experiment with a new TCP flag combination beyond the built-in TCP scan types, you can do so using --scanflags. For instance, if you want to set SYN, RST, and FIN simultaneously, you can do so using --scanflags RSTSYNFIN.

## Spoofing

the attacker launching the command nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP. Consequently, Nmap will craft all the packets using the provided source IP address SPOOFED_IP. The target machine will respond to the incoming packets sending the replies to the destination IP address SPOOFED_IP. For this scan to work and give accurate results, the attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyze the replies.

you expect to specify the network interface using -e and to explicitly disable ping scan -Pn. Therefore, instead of nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP, you will need to issue nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP to tell Nmap explicitly which network interface to use and not to expect to receive a ping reply. It is worth repeating that this scan will be useless if the attacker system cannot monitor the network for responses.

When you are on the same subnet as the target machine, you would be able to spoof your MAC address as well. You can specify the source MAC address using --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).

## Decoys

You can launch a decoy scan by specifying a specific or random IP address after -D. For example, nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,ME MACHINE_IP will make the scan of MACHINE_IP appear as coming from the IP addresses 10.10.0.1, 10.10.0.2, and then ME to indicate that your IP address should appear in the third order. Another example command would be nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME MACHINE_IP, where the third and fourth source IP addresses are assigned randomly, while the fifth source is going to be the attacker’s IP address. In other words, each time you execute the latter command, you would expect two new random IP addresses to be the third and fourth decoy sources.

## Fragmented Packets
Nmap provides the option -f to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the --mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.

To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset

## Zombie Scan
Spoofing the source IP address can be a great approach to scanning stealthily. However, spoofing will only work in specific network setups. It requires you to be in a position where you can monitor the traffic. Considering these limitations, spoofing your IP address can have little use; however, we can give it an upgrade with the idle scan.

The idle scan, or zombie scan, requires an idle system connected to the network that you can communicate with. Practically, Nmap will make each probe appear as if coming from the idle (zombie) host, then it will check for indicators whether the idle (zombie) host received any response to the spoofed probe. This is accomplished by checking the IP identification (IP ID) value in the IP header. You can run an idle scan using nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP MACHINE_IP, where ZOMBIE_IP is the IP address of the idle host (zombie).

The idle (zombie) scan requires the following three steps to discover whether a port is open:

Trigger the idle host to respond so that you can record the current IP ID on the idle host.
Send a SYN packet to a TCP port on the target. The packet should be spoofed to appear as if it was coming from the idle host (zombie) IP address.
Trigger the idle machine again to respond so that you can compare the new IP ID with the one received earlier.
