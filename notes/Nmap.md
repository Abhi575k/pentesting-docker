# Nmap

### TCP Connect Scan

nmap -sT <ip>

SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK -> RST/ACK

### TCP SYN Scan

nmap -sS <ip>

SYN -> SYN/ACK -> RST

Requires sudo

### UDP Scan

nmap -sU <ip>

SYN (receives a host unreachable flag if port closed)


### Scan Timings

You can control the scan timing using -T<0-5>. -T0 is the slowest (paranoid), while -T5 is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:

paranoid (0)
sneaky (1)
polite (2)
normal (3)
aggressive (4)
insane (5)

Alternatively, you can choose to control the packet rate using --min-rate <number> and --max-rate <number>. For example, --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.

Moreover, you can control probing parallelization using --min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>. Nmap probes the targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open; probing parallelization specifies the number of such probes that can be run in parallel. For instance, --min-parallelism=512 pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel; these 512 probes are related to host discovery and open ports.

-F	100 most common ports

-r	scan ports in consecutive order
