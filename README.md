# Pentesting Docker

This Docker has been developed by me and consists of all the common techniques during enumeration of a machine. All the scripts included have been developed by me over time while working on machines from 'hackthebox.com' and 'tryhackme.com'.

## Usage

The filesystem is as follows:

./bin contains all the binaries developed by me which use pentesting tools with specefic flags

./etc contains all the configuration files

./lib(currently empty) contains all the requirements for my binaries

./opt contains all the popular wordlists which are actively used by me

./root/ctf is the working directory where all the scans are stored; a webserver is hosted on the docker which makes it easier to access data from our host system
